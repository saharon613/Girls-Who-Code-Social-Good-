    <h1>Take Action</h1>
    <p>We can all take action and have a part in solving this problem by putting pressure on government and law enforcement. We need to demand safety for young children, sanitary production facilites, and fair pay for all workers. Laws should be put in place to ensure companies treat their workers fairly and these laws should be enforced. If not followed, companies should face consequences. </p>
