    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>My name is Shoshana. I chose to create a website about the immoral production behind many consumer goods. This is a problem that should be concerning to all. We all as consumers need to demand improvements for the sake of laborers and all of humanity. No young child should feel forced to work. Laborers should work in good conditions and recieve fair pay.  </p>
